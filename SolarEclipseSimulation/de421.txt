DE 421 JPL Planetary Ephemeris SPK
==================================

Original file name:  de421.bsp
Creation date:       Feb. 13, 2008
File created by:     Dr. William Folkner (SSD/JPL)
Comments added by:   Nat Bachman (NAIF/JPL)

This SPK file was released on February 13, 2008 by the Solar System
Dynamics Group of JPL's Guidance, Navigation, and Control section.

The DE 421 planetary ephemeris is described in JPL IOM 343R-08-002,
dated Feb. 13, 2008. The introduction of that memo states, in part,
that this ephemeris "represents an overall update for all
planets, and so is suitable for use for any purpose limited
by the integration time span of approximately 1900-2050."
The memo also states that this ephemeris "is the successor to
the best previously released ephemeris DE 418."

One of the release memo's authors has indicated that a more
comprehensive and "less Phoenix-centric" version of the file release
memo is forthcoming; the date of the new memo is TDB.
